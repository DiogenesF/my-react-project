### This is a little project that I created right after learning the concepts of React
I was still testing some features and this project was made just to practice with what I had just learned at the time.

### You check it out here:

### What is really cool about it is the `Games` page, where you can choose between Tic-Tae-Toe or Rock-Paper-Scissors.

# Tic-Tac-Toe:

### To run this application, you can just go to the root folder and run:

### `$ npm install`

and

### `$ npm start`
